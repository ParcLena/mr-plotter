# **mr-plotter**
**Mister plotter** (*mr-plotter*) is an **user-friendly** Python tool which creates **paper-ready mass-radius diagrams** with your favourite theoretical models. It also includes the ability to **color-code diagrams** based on any published stellar or planetary property collected in the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).

## Installation & Requirements

Just **clone or download** this folder into your computer. All the dependencies used are very well-known and probably you already have them installed in a recent version compatible with *mr-plotter*. However, if this is not the case, you can just enter the folder via terminal and type

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you have any problem with the installation please drop me and issue [here](https://github.com/castro-gzlz/mr-plotter/issues) :smiley:.

## Usage

To run *mr-plotter* you just need to create a **.ini** file and then type

```
python mr-plotter.py my_config_file.ini
```
The file my_config_file.ini should contain all the necessary information to make your plot, which will be **saved into the output** folder both in **.pdf** and **.png** formats. In the [config.ini file] you can find a detailed explanation of each option than can be used. If this is your first time using *mr-plotter*, I invite you to follow along with the tutorial and see some examples that I have prepared to illustrate the operation of the package in diferent scenarios (some of them might be of interest for you!).
